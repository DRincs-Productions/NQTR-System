This repo is a complete set of tools to create a game where you can explore and relate to characters.

In order to simplify the update work and avoid errors in saving I created functions that check the correct state of variables by inserting them in [after_load](game/tool/core.rpy#L1) (e.g. after a change to a quest that causes a stage to be blocked, the quest should restart) and an abundant use of define.

For the time being, a good part of the screens and images are not of my creation and terminology, and the comments need to be revised.

Feel free to contribute, fork this and send a pull request. ðŸ˜„

## Instructions to insert Toolkit in your repo

I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:

- [**Pull branch**](#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (to improve the repo or create a Toolkit based on mine)
- [Manually](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/#:~:text=To%20do%20this%2C%20go%20to,likely%20in%20your%20Downloads%20folder.) (not recommended)

### Pull branch

To **insert** or **update** the Toolkit in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **NQTR-toolkit**

```shell
git checkout -b NQTR-toolkit
git checkout NQTR-toolkit
git pull https://github.com/DonRP/NQTR-toolkit.git tool-only --allow-unrelated-histories
```

At the end make a merge inside the arm of the project.

### Talk system

The Talk system is related to routines. As explained in [Routine system](#Routine-system) the TalkObject() classes are inserted in the following ways:

```renpy
# This will start the default dialog
Commitment(chs={"alice" : None}, ...)
Commitment(chs={"alice" : TalkObject(bg_before_after="bg alice roomsleep"}, ...)
# Doing so will start label_talk of the TalkObject() class (explained later).
Commitment(chs={"alice" : TalkObject(bg_before_after="bg alice roomsleep", label_talk="talk_sleep")}, ...)
```

The TalkObject () class has no required parameters, and has the following parameters:

label_talk: is the label where the dialogue is located. IMPORTANT: If not specified it will start "label talk" (explained later).

ch_secondary: for group dialogs, you need to specify other chs besides the primary ch (in process).

bg_talk: is the image shown while speaking.

bg_before_after: by default when the dialogue is finished the image before the dialogue is shown. otherwise specify in the bg_before_after parameter the image you want to show after the dialog.

after_label_event: TODO:

###### Talk system default

As specified before if you don't specify label_talk in TalkObject() the default dialog will be started: first "label talk", after "label talk_menu".

```renpy
default talkch_choices = {}

label talk:
    if (talk_image != None):
        scene expression (talk_image) as bg

    if(talk_ch == None):
        call error_label
        call screen room_navigation

    # Costume Code
    if(talk_ch == "alice"):
        mc "Hi [a]"
        a "Hi, can you tell me something?"
    else:
        "Now is busy test later."

    call talk_menu
    jump talk_end
```

label talk: is a label used to give the possibility to customize the dialog even more.

label talk_menu: is a label that shows the choices contained in talkch_choices.

To add the choices in talkch_choices:

```renpy
addTalkChoice(ch = "alice", choice_text = _("About the Ann"), label = "stage_talkalice")
```

To remove the choices in talkch_choices:

```renpy
delTalkChoice(ch = "alice", choice_text = _("About the Ann"))
```

# Time

The class that handles Time is TimeHandler, and if you don't want defaust values you have to change "default tm = TimeHandler()" in [tool/time_handler.rpy](/game/tool/time_handler.rpy). Which has 4 non-obligatory parameters:

hour_new_day: This is the time that is set using the ".new_day ()" function. The ".new_day()" function in addition to passing the changeover to a new day, checks for morning events and checks for "expired" items.

hour & day: the hour and day set at the start of the game.

weekend_day: a value for the weekend day (in process)

has some very important functions, but I suggest managing everything (where possible) with [#Time-Label] (# Time-Label)

Some very intuitive functions:

```renpy
def get_day_number(self):
    #...
def get_weekday_number(self):
    #...
def get_weekday_name(self):
    #...
def new_hour(self, amt=event_duration):
    #...
def new_day(self):
    #...
```

get_hour_name (self): Returns the name of the current timeframe contained in "hour_names". e.g. morning, afternoon ...
To insert images that change over time:

```renpy
image bg annroom = "location/annroom-[tm.image_time].webp"
```

now_is_between (self, end, start = 0): check if the current time is between start and end.

I have set by default that when you wait you wait for 1 hour, if you want to change for example to manage morning, afternoon, evening and night just change wait_hour to [tool/time_label.rpy](/game/tool/time_label.rpy)

```renpy
define wait_hour = 1
```

I have also inserted a time block, which is unlocked by default: bl_values.get("block_spendtime") (guarda [bl_values]()). If it is active it displays the following text of the variable "block_spendtime_dialogue" which is in [tool/time_label.rpy](/game/tool/time_label.rpy)

```renpy
define block_spendtime_dialogue = _("You can't do that now")
```

###### Time Label

To manage time I recommend using the label in [tool/time_label.rpy](/game/tool/time_label.rpy), or the Shares you find in [tool/action_label.rpy](/game/tool/action_label.rpy)

```renpy
label new_day:
    #...

label wait:
    #...

label after_wait:
    # Used after an event or a wait, it updates valid values and makes various checks to know if there are any events in the current time
```

The following advice to customize to your liking:

```renpy
label wait_onehour:
    #...

label nap:
    #...

label sleep:
    #...
```
