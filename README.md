This repo is a complete set of tools to create a game where you can explore and relate to characters.

In order to simplify the update work and avoid errors in saving I created functions that check the correct state of variables by inserting them in [after_load](game/tool/core.rpy#L1) (e.g. after a change to a quest that causes a stage to be blocked, the quest should restart) and an abundant use of define.

For the time being, a good part of the screens and images are not of my creation and terminology, and the comments need to be revised.

Feel free to contribute, fork this and send a pull request. 😄

## Instructions to insert Toolkit in your repo

I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:

- [**Pull branch**](#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (to improve the repo or create a Toolkit based on mine)
- [Manually](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/#:~:text=To%20do%20this%2C%20go%20to,likely%20in%20your%20Downloads%20folder.) (not recommended)

### Pull branch

To **insert** or **update** the Toolkit in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **NQTR-toolkit**

```shell
git checkout -b NQTR-toolkit
git checkout NQTR-toolkit
git pull https://github.com/DonRP/NQTR-toolkit.git tool-only --allow-unrelated-histories

```

At the end make a merge inside the arm of the project.
