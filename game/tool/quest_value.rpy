# Stage

# quest_stages: is the list of all existing Stage tasks.
# it is used to keep all information about all Stages

# current_quest_stages: are the Stage currently active,
# contains only the data strictly necessary for proper operation
# after their completion they are replaced with the next one

# Task
# current_task_stages is identical to this_current, 
# except that after completion they are not replaced by the next one, but eliminated. 
# The idea is that the Tasks are not within the "Stage" and therefore have no subsequent internships.

# Quest
# the Quest is a list of Stages that follow each other according to their order
# quests and quests_levels are synchronized, meaning they will always have the same elements

# quests_levels: must not have elements at the beginning. what is it for? to know which number of this has arrived at an internship
# quest_stages is similar to quest_stages and contains information about internships

default quests_levels = {}
default current_quest_stages = {}
default current_task_stages = {}

# if you need a description of the quest that true over time this dictionary seemed to me the best way to do it
default quests_descriptions = {}
